# UAV-Strategic-Deconfliction-System
A Python-based system for detecting, explaining, and resolving spatial-temporal conflicts between UAV missions. Features 4D (3D + time) visualizations, conflict reporting, and automated resolution strategies.
---

## ✨ Features
- **Conflict Detection** – Identifies when the primary drone’s path intersects with other drones in both space and time.
- **Conflict Explanation** – Returns the exact location, timestamp, and IDs of drones involved.
- **Conflict Resolution** – Adjusts mission start time to avoid unsafe overlaps.
- **2D & 4D Visualization** – Plots flight paths and highlights conflict points in space-time.
- **Modular Design** – Easily integrate with real-time UAV Traffic Management systems.
